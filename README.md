## Adding/Changing Characters
Feel free to pull request any changes to "random" characters. Random characters are characters that have not been accurately changed (e.g thorium reactor is suicidal). I cannot cater to every single one, so if you have an idea, please submit a pull request with the description following the template.

If you want to update whole categories, you may do so, as long as you update no more than one team each time. If you want to add new categories, ask me first to make sure I am not already doing so

# Mindustry in Murder Games
Murder Games is an automatic Hunger Games Simulator (https://orteil.dashnet.org/murdergames/). This project aims to put all aspects of Mindustry into Murdergames.

## Customizing Characters
Feel free to pull request any changes to random characters. Random characters are characters that have not been customized to match their purpose. I cannot cater to every single one, so I request that if you have an idea, submit it following this format:

Character name
Pronouns | Perks | Item

If you want to update whole categories, you may do so, as long as you update no more than one team each time. If you want to add new categories, ask me first to make sure I am not already doing so

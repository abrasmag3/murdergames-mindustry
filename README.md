# Mindustry in Murder Games
Murder Games is an automatic Hunger Games Simulator (https://orteil.dashnet.org/murdergames/). This project aims to put all aspects of Mindustry into Murdergames.

## Customizing Characters
Feel free to pull request any changes to random characters. Random characters are characters that have not been customized to match their purpose. I cannot cater to every single one, so I request that if you have an idea, submit it following this format:

Character name
Pronouns | Perks | Item

If you want to add whole new categories such as Status Effects, you may do so, but most likely I am already working on them...
